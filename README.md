# Extension Privacy Policy

# Intro
Different extensions use personal data in different ways. This privacy policy encompasses general principles of how extensions I create collect and handle personal data. Individual extensions, when you first use them, will display their own unique privacy policies and ask you to agree to them before continued use.

# Data Collection
At this moment, none of the extensions I have authored collect any personal data. Since no data is collected, none of your data can be sold to third parties.

That being said, there are a few other ways your data is used.

# Chrome Storage API
My extension takes advantage of Google Chrome's Storage API to locally store minimal state information. This is similar to a cookie. Examples of data stored this way might include the GPT model or custom prompt instructions you prefer. Google syncs this information across your various computers and Chrome installations. However, my extensions only access this data locally on your machine and they do not transmit it.

# Third-Party Software
The extensions do involve data transfer to a third party, at this time, limited to OpenAI. The data transfer does not happen in the background, but is user-initiated via a button-click. A successful data transfer requires that the user has an active OpenAI account and would at the point fall under OpenAI's privacy policy found here: https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy

# Changes to the Privacy Policy
If there are any non-trivial changes made to this blanket privacy policy or to the individual privacy policies of any of my extensions, I will push out a new version of the affected extension(s) and ask you to agree to the amended privacy policy.

# Feedback
If you have questions or concerns about this privacy policy, feel free to file an issue to this repository.
